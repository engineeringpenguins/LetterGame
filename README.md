# Intro

A friend and I were lamenting how people are interested in handwriting letters but do not reply. We started a written dialogue in a gamified format. This document was created for us to be on the same page (pun intended) and to share our framework for anyone that could benefit from it.

# System

The 'game of letters' combines elements of role playing games (RPGs) with choose your own adventure storytelling through handwritten correspondence

### Game Mechanics

To play the game handwritten letters are exchanged by mail between the players. Typically 2 people will be playing that will repeat the cycle of receiving a letter and sending a letter. Players determine what is a reasonable expectation for response times and the overall duration of the game.

#### Deviation for > 2 players:

While the core mechanic works best with two players, larger groups can adapt the system. Rather than copying letters by hand for each recipient, consider writing individual letters that reference the broader game world and acknowledge events from other correspondences.

### Universal law (within the system):

**The responder has ultimate freedom in the direction of the story**

We agree that this is the only rule to follow when playing the game. There is no situation where the responder should lack creative freedom. To assist with interpretation of this rule we employ loose guidelines (by nature these can be disregarded if contrary to the one rule).
#### Supporting Guidelines:

1. Nothing established prior to the response is considered permanent
2. Reality is conditional and subjective, truth is relative and can be ever changing
3. Your own creative joy is the priority (to the detriment of recipient if necessary)
4. Poor quality work should always be sent rather than nothing at all (reject refinement)
5. Dialogue about the game story should take place within letters as much as possible

### Recommendations

Archive letters you send and receive. Things will inevitably get forgotten but you should have a tool that you can use to review the current game. This can be as simple as taking a photo of your letter before you send it. Using a digital note taking system (like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)) would be advantageous if you anticipate your game being more complex.

Read books! Especially if you do not write stories often. You can read any genre that you want, the goal is to be exposed to written ideas and stories. Books and movies are referenced further below, if you want to see examples of stories built on dialogue/letters: [The Screwtape Letters](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8130077-the-screwtape-letters) or gothic fiction like [Dracula](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17245.Dracula)/[Frankenstein](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35031085-frankenstein) may be insightful. 

Most importantly: experiment and write letters even if they are not good (by your assessment).

# Creativity Models

You can introduce all sorts of creative techniques and mediums into your dialogue. These are some of the ones we have come up with.

### Nested Stories

You can have a story within a story. Not only is it fun to break out of your current character, you can also build on your story indirectly. In our story the two characters are collaborating on a manuscript in addition to everything else going on in the world. They send each other additions or modifications to the current chapter being worked on as time permits (not present in every letter). 

#### Practical Examples:

-  Another story is included in addition to current story
-  There is another story present inside of a parent story - theatre/acting, song, poetic epic, etc.
-  Experiences like dreams or other messages a character shares

#### Pop Culture Examples: 

-  [House of Leaves](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24800.House_of_Leaves)
-  [Canterbury Tales](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9767612-the-canterburry-tales)
-  [1001 Arabian Nights](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7123161-the-arabian-nights)

### Generational Growth

The current characters do not have to be the final characters. The story can take place in real-time or span hundreds/thousands of years. Great works using this technique deliver a powerful emotional impact to the audience. This game is not intended to create great works, it is still fun to establish worldbuilding through evolution and show (very) long term results. The risk is that moving too quickly feels undeveloped and lacks any emotional stake. We have not yet introduced this into our story.

#### Practical Examples:

-  Insight into future/past events - Omniscience, Prophecy, Quantum mechanics
-  Story changes characters/narrators as time progresses - progenitor -> current father -> son
-  Active character is immortal and story is a mix of flashbacks and their continuing journey

#### Pop Culture Examples:

- [Dune](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44767458-dune)
- [One Hundred Years of Solitude](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/320.One_Hundred_Years_of_Solitude)
- [Star Wars](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk)

### Unreliable Narrator

Truth is in the eye of the beholder at a given place in time. This can take the form of intentionally omitting or misdirection within your letter or destroying a part of the senders letter. This technique can get out of control quickly so we are currently just using it to hijack the other persons reality told in the letter vs. writing the characters with some kind of knowledge bias or motive. 

#### Practical Examples:

-  "You got this part wrong in your last letter" or "You forgot this ..."
-  Establish the last letter and this one are in a dream/magic/illusion/etc.
-  Employ double meanings and (incorrect) subjective interpretations

#### Pop Culture Examples:

-  [American Psycho](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0144084/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk)
-  [Rashomon](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042876/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk)
-  [Fight Club](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk)

### Visual Media

In our game one player is stronger at writing description while the other contributes through drawings (ex. floorplans and sketches). This technique has a risk of delaying a letter until something is of a certain quality. We hold that all creative trash is acceptable, the game must be protected at all costs.

#### Practical Examples:

- Artistic rendering - portrait, landscape, storyboard
- Scientific data - alien physiology, flora/fauna, maps, flower pressings
- Story artifact - sacred works, folklore, visual cipher, scented paper

#### Pop Culture Examples:

-  Maps & sketches by J.R.R. Tolkien in [Lord of the Rings](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33.The_Lord_of_the_Rings)
-  The cover & binding of any book
-  The black spot in [Treasure Island](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/295.Treasure_Island)

### Situational Letter

Sometimes an event in the real or game world can cause a letter to be in a different format or style. The most common example might be not having enough time to write a lengthy letter. You can just write a short letter with more hurried handwriting and describe an in-game event that is causing the letter to be rushed & incomplete.

#### Practical Examples:

-  Writing in vague or coded language like your letters are under observation
-  Changes in tone/style that indicate something is different about the writers situation
-  Intentionally redacting/blacking out words or sections of your letter to imply censorship

#### Pop Culture Examples:

-  Wartime correspondence
-  Documents with secret/classified content
-  Social media posts

# Scenarios

Any exchange will grow organically into its own story, the pace, style, and duration are determined by the players. This is the most difficult part of the game and is also the most fun. If the players are struggling to build a world, borrow from an existing one. Choose a backdrop of [Greek mythology](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23520.The_Complete_World_of_Greek_Mythology) or [Star Trek](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092455/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk). 

Some frameworks allow the game to be played infinitely and others allow for a pre-determined end state.

## Infinite Variations

### Null

We found it best to start with no scenario at all. The person starting the game sends a letter and the response builds on the first letter in some way. This type of story has no existing foundation and is developed iteratively. This method inherently means that the story might be difficult to establish at the beginning and the world will feel vague and unformed for a while. In our story the locations are still abstract and the only thing we have established about the setting is that it is in a time where language and handwriting letters exist.

### Dungeons and Dragons

You could do a [DnD](https://www.dndbeyond.com/) style campaign with both authors being simultaneously a Game Master and Player Character. There is a lot of existing worldbuilding and mechanics for the DnD world that could be easily borrowed into your own system.

## Finite Variations

### Video Game

When we started discussing a gamified dialogue one of the first things that came to mind was [Zork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork). Similar to the DnD style above both players would be GM and PC but this time there is a pre-determined end state of the game. When the win condition is met the game concludes. This framework would be new to me, I think the win condition would need to be concrete with as little context as possible.

### Blitz Event

This framework is to quickly try an idea or if you wanted to try the game without committing to a lengthy dialogue. Both players would agree on a limiting factor of the game (number of letters or real-world time). Darker themes might be a fictitious upcoming world/life ending event. If you choose a less morbid/final conclusion you could theoretically stitch multiple individual blitz events together into a single story.
